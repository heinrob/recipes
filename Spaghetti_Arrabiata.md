*vegetarian, vegan*

**4 Servings**

---

- *100 ml* olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- *2* dried red chilies or peperoncino, crumbled or finely chopped
- *4* cloves garlic, finely sliced
- *1* red onion, finely chopped
- *1200 g* canned plum tomatoes, sieved
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- *500 g* spaghetti
- *5 ml* red wine vinegar
- *45 g* stale bread crumbs
- *1 tbsp* fresh thyme, chopped (optional)
- Fried sage leaves (optional)

1. Heat about 5 tablespoons / 75 ml of the oil in a large sauté pan over low heat. Add the chilies, garlic and onion, and cook gently for around 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and let them cook until the sauce is quite thick, about 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti in the salted boiling water according to the packet instructions. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/4 cup / 60 ml of the cooking water.

3. Once the sauce has thickened, add the red vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. To make the pangrattato, heat the remaining oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and thyme, if desired, and fry until the bread crumbs are crispy, about 3 minutes.

5. Add the drained pasta and the reserved pasta water to the sauce, and toss to coat. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the pangrattato over the top. If you like, you can garnish with fried sage leaves.
